# Peer Graded Assignment: Course Project 1

## Running code
There are four scripts that each generates a plot as per the instructions for this assignment.
Each script will read the data from the original file household_power_consumption.txt.

NOTE: The file “household_power_consumption.txt” should be in the working directory where the scripts are.

To run each script simply type source and the name of the file. For example to run plot1.R :

source(“plot1.R”)

### Reading and plotting data
Data is read only for the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. It uses the function table and skips the right number of lines until it reaches the dates that are important.

The plots are made after reading the data.
